Hope the assets work well - if not, please write to slsovest@gmail.com


Assets that may work with Hot Rod Constructor
_________________________________________

The package was made to be working with Synty Studios "POLYGON" assets
- it's made to scale with those
- texture brightness matches
- POLYGON characters work with vehicle-related animations

The style doesn't match perfectly - the vehicles should be "polygonated" 
by hardening all the soft edges in the geometry (by tweaking normals).
It can be done by selecting the model and hitting "Normals - Harden Edges" command in 3d editor.
As far as I know, it may double the number of model's of vertices in Unity though.

PolyWorld assets on the Asset Store seem to have a tool to tweak the meshes in a similar way.


Assembly hints
______________

- Some "Body" parts consist of a number of separate meshes that you can remove
to get more variations (many roofs can be detached).
- You can make any rigged chassis wider or higher by just moving the "Wheel" joints
- Not all the fenders match all the "Body" parts
(they can show up inside the interior or pickup trunk).
